# Dicom-3D-visualization
notebooks on 3D visualizations of a dicom series files which is read by pydicom

In both notebooks i go thruogh the process of reading every dicom file in a directory as a slice and turning the data into a 3d numpy array ready for visualization.
using itkwidgets was easier to my experience due to better visualization and easy navigation of the 3d image
here are screenshots of the result:
